My-first-project-on-the-odin-project

In the project I have made total 4 web pages.The pages shows the recipes and images. I have learned about the structure of html then various tags like <p> <img> Heading tags and links tag <a>. I have made the pages and link them to the index page.
From the index page we can visit the different recipe pages and we can come back to index page by the links to the index page (as the name 'All Recipe page').
